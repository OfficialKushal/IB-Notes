                <p>Corporate actions refer to any event that brings a material change to a company, affecting its stakeholders. This includes shareholders (common and preferred), bondholders, creditors, promoters, employees, and the board of directors. These events are usually approved by the company's board of directors and can have significant impacts on the company’s stock and operations.</p>

                <h4>Primary Reasons for Corporate Actions</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Return Profits to Shareholders:</b> For example, cash dividends and bonus issues are used to reward shareholders. While a bonus issue typically should not affect the stock price, in rare cases, it may lead to an increase in value.</li>
                    <li><b>Influence the Share Price:</b> Corporate actions like stock splits, reverse stock splits, and buybacks can influence the stock price by altering the number of outstanding shares.</li>
                    <li><b>Corporate Restructuring:</b> Mergers, spinoffs, and demergers are corporate actions where companies reorganize themselves to enhance profitability and focus on core competencies.</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>1. Mandatory Corporate Action</h4>
                <p>A mandatory corporate action is an event initiated by the corporation’s board of directors that affects all stakeholders. Participation is compulsory for all stakeholders in these actions.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>BRUP (Bankruptcy):</b> The company announces bankruptcy protection and begins legal proceedings to decide pay-outs to stakeholders.</li>
                    <li><b>DVCA (Dividend in Cash):</b> The company distributes profits to shareholders in the form of cash dividends.</li>
                    <li><b>DVSE (Dividend in Stock):</b> The company issues additional shares (instead of cash) to its shareholders.</li>
                    <li><b>BONU (Bonus Issue):</b> Shareholders receive additional shares free of cost, typically when the company makes supernormal profits.</li>
                    <li><b>DLST (Delisting):</b> Securities are delisted, meaning they can no longer be traded in the market.</li>
                    <li><b>MRGR (Merger):</b> Two or more companies merge into one new entity. Shares of old companies are exchanged for shares of the new company at a set ratio.</li>

                    <li><b>SPLF (Stock Split):</b> The company divides its shares into multiple shares, maintaining the same total value of the shares but changing their nominal value.</li>
                    <li><b>SPLR (Reverse Stock Split):</b> The company reduces the number of shares in circulation while increasing the nominal value per share.</li>
                    <li><b>NMCH (Name Change):</b> The company changes its name, usually approved at a General Meeting, with no effect on capital or shareholders.</li>
                    <li><b>GNNR (General Announcement):</b> A notification by the company to inform shareholders of various events, with no effect on the capital or shareholders.</li>
                </ul>
    
                <h4>2. Voluntary Corporate Action</h4>
                <p>A voluntary corporate action allows shareholders to choose whether or not to participate. Shareholders must respond for the action to be processed.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>DRIP (Dividend Reinvestment Plan):</b> Shareholders can opt to reinvest their dividends in the company rather than receive them in cash or stock. Reinvesting is typically tax-free.</li>

                <h4>3. Mandatory with Choice Corporate Action</h4>
                <p>This type of action is mandatory, but shareholders are given a choice between options. If no election is made, the default option applies.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>DVOP (Dividend in Cash/Stock Option):</b> Shareholders can choose to receive dividends in either cash or stock, and the amount received will be taxable.</li>
                    <li><b>BONL (Bonus with Election):</b> Shareholders are given the choice to receive bonus shares or cash as part of the company’s supernormal profits.</li>
                    <li><b>MRGL (Merger with Elections):</b> When companies merge, shareholders are given options about how they want to receive the merged company's shares.</li>
                </ul>
