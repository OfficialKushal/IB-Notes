        <h4>Pricing and Valuation</h4>
        <p>
            Bond prices and yields have an inverse relationship. Bonds can trade at a discount (price < par value) or premium (price > par value).
        </p>
        <p><b>Formula:</b></p>
        <p>
            <code>
            Price = &Sigma; (Coupon Payment / (1 + YTM)<sup>t</sup>) + (Par Value / (1 + YTM)<sup>n</sup>)
            </code>

            <li><b>Credit Risk:</b> Risk of issuer defaulting on payments.</li>
            <li><b>Liquidity Risk:</b> Difficulty in buying or selling the bond.</li>

        <h4>Duration and Convexity</h4>
        <p><b>Duration:</b> Measures bond price sensitivity to interest rate changes. Modified duration approximates the percentage price change for a 1% change in yield.</p>
        <p><b>Convexity:</b> Reflects the curvature of the price-yield relationship, offering a more accurate measure of price sensitivity.</p>

        <h4>Yield Curve</h4>
        <p>
            The yield curve illustrates the relationship between bond yields and maturities.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Normal Yield Curve:</b> Upward sloping; longer maturities have higher yields.</li>
            <li><b>Inverted Yield Curve:</b> Downward sloping; often signals economic slowdown.</li>
            <li><b>Flat Yield Curve:</b> Minimal difference in yields across maturities.</li>
