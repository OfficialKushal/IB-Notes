        <p>

        <h4>1. What is Clearing?</h4>
        <p>
            Clearing defines the obligations of buyers and sellers in a trade, ensuring they fulfill their commitments to exchange cash or securities.
        </p>
        <p><b>Role of Clearing Houses:</b> Clearing houses act as central counterparties (CCPs), becoming the buyer for every seller and the seller for every buyer. This process, called <b>novation</b>, reduces counterparty risk.</p>
        <p><b>Netting:</b></p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Netting consolidates multiple transactions into a single obligation, reducing the number of payments or deliveries.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Types of Netting:</b>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Bilateral Netting:</b> Between two parties (e.g., A owes B $10, B owes A $5, net = A pays B $5).</li>
                    <li><b>Multilateral Netting:</b> Among multiple parties through a clearinghouse, further reducing credit risk.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h4>2. What is Settlement?</h4>
        <p>
            Settlement transfers the legal ownership of securities from seller to buyer in exchange for cash.

        <p><b>Steps in Settlement:</b></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Begins after clearing defines obligations.</li>

        </ul>
        <p><b>Key Terms:</b></p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Delivery vs. Payment (DvP):</b> Ensures securities and cash are exchanged simultaneously, protecting against counterparty default.</li>
            <li><b>Rolling Settlement:</b> Trades settle a fixed number of business days after the trade date (e.g., T+2 in India, T+1 in the U.S.).</li>
        </ul>
