        <h4>Types of Reconciliation</h4>

        <h4>1. External Reconciliations</h4>
        <p>External reconciliation compares the bankâ€™s internal records with external sources like custodians or counterparties. Key categories include:</p>
        <table>
            <thead>
                <tr>
                    <th>Category</th>
                    <th>Description</th>
                    <th>Timing</th>
                    <th>Risks Addressed</th>
                </tr>
            </thead>
            <tbody>
                <tr>
                    <td>Depot/Stock Reconciliation</td>
                    <td>Internal vs. custodian records</td>
                    <td>Post-Trade</td>
                    <td>Missed trades, incorrect bookings</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Nostro/Cash Reconciliation</td>
                    <td>Internal ledger vs. Nostro account</td>
                    <td>Post-Trade</td>
                    <td>Untracked cash movements</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Exchange Reconciliation</td>
                    <td>FO bookings vs. exchange executions</td>
                    <td>Pre-Trade</td>
